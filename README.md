# Blender WebXR Tools

Some tools to help.

## Notes
- ðŸš¨ These tools have only been used with MacOS.
- ðŸš¨ For macOS users, all exports scripts require blender to be opened via the command line.

## Known Bugs
- If there is anything that isn't XML (like a conditional, say) RETURNMODE will misfire and not change anything, but save the JSX file to the model dir.

## Credits
Everything in here was entirely or partially written by ChatGPT. 

I started with the very useful [blender-addon-template](https://github.com/lunadigital/blender-addon-template).
